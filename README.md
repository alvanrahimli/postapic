# Post a Pic!
Feed for pictures posted by homies

Have you ever wanted to have a small, cozy place where only your friends can submit a random picture, and everyone can see it? 

Well, I have. So, we created postapic!

With postapic, predefined users can submit a photo and see what others have shared. And that is all. No likes, upvotes, comments, notifications, etc.

# Installation
- Clone the repository
- run `docker compose up -d` ([docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/alvanrahimli/postapic/blob/master/docker-compose.yml))
